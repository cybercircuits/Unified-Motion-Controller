The Unified Motion Controller is more than just another serial interface motor controller. The Unified Motion Controller has a pair of discrete H-bridge drivers to run not one but two motors at up to 45A each (initial figure, exact specifications TBD). Connections are provided to connect a quadrature encoder for each motor, which can be used alongside onboard motor current sensing circuitry for full closed-loop PID control.

Control methods supported:
-Analog voltages up to 3.3V (potentiometers, DAC outputs, etc)
-Buttons located on the board
-I2C
-RC pulse
-SPI
-UART
-USB

Input voltages up to 40V are supported. When running motors off of 6V or less, a separate 5V logic supply must also be given.

SOFTWARE USED:
PCB design: KiCad (2012-01-19 BZR 3256)-stable
